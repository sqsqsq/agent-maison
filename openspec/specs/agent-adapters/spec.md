# Agent Adapters Specification

## Purpose

Define how AgentMaison exposes framework skills to different AI coding assistants
via adapter plugins without duplicating skill logic or phase rules.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Each adapter is a self-contained plugin directory

The system SHALL require every adapter to live under `agents/<adapter_name>/` with
an `adapter.yaml` that conforms to `agents/adapter-schema.yaml`.

#### Scenario: Known adapters present
- **WHEN** the framework is inspected for supported adapters
- **THEN** `agents/cursor/adapter.yaml`, `agents/claude/adapter.yaml`, and `agents/generic/adapter.yaml` MUST exist and validate against the schema

> **Enforced by:** `agents/adapter-schema.yaml`, `agents/cursor/adapter.yaml`, `agents/claude/adapter.yaml`, `agents/generic/adapter.yaml`

### Requirement: Adapters do not contain skill logic

The system MUST NOT allow adapters to embed phase rules or skill workflow logic;
adapters SHALL only expose skill entry points (slash commands, bridge files, rules)
to the instance project root.

#### Scenario: Phase rules remain centralized
- **WHEN** an adapter generates instance-level configuration
- **THEN** it MUST NOT write phase rules; all phase rules MUST remain in `specs/phase-rules/*.yaml`

> **Enforced by:** `agents/adapter-schema.yaml` (design constraints section), `specs/phase-rules/`

### Requirement: Adapter outputs target instance project root

The system SHALL generate all adapter artifacts relative to the consumer instance
project root, not inside the framework submodule directory.

#### Scenario: Agent entry file targets instance root
- **WHEN** framework-init runs with a selected adapter
- **THEN** the generated agent entry file (e.g. `AGENTS.md`) MUST appear at the instance project root as defined by `agent_entry_file.target_path` in the adapter config

> **Enforced by:** `agents/*/adapter.yaml`, `skills/project/framework-init/SKILL.md`, `harness/scripts/check-init.ts`

### Requirement: Project init materializes multiple adapters

Project init MUST support `materialized_adapters` with one
`materialize-adapter:<name>` task per adapter. Committed artifacts for each
adapter MUST be rendered using that adapter identity, not the personal
`local.agent_adapter`.

#### Scenario: Claude and Cursor artifacts coexist
- **WHEN** `materialized_adapters` is `["claude","cursor"]`
- **THEN** both `.claude/` and `.cursor/` (and entry files) MAY exist without conflict

> **Enforced by:** `harness/scripts/utils/init-task-planner.ts`,
> `harness/scripts/init-orchestrate.ts`

### Requirement: Personal setup does not write project artifacts

Personal setup MUST only write `framework.local.json` and MUST use
`assert-active-adapter-materialized` as a read-only check **before**
`record-adapter`. If the chosen adapter is not materialized, setup MUST stop
and direct the user to project init without writing local config.

#### Scenario: Setup writes only framework.local.json
- **WHEN** personal setup completes S3 for `record-adapter` and optional
  `record-deveco-path`
- **THEN** only `framework.local.json` MUST be created or updated; project
  config and adapter directories MUST NOT be modified by setup tasks

#### Scenario: Assert failure does not write local config
- **WHEN** S3 runs personal setup with `activeAdapter` whose entry file is not
  materialized
- **THEN** `assert-active-adapter-materialized` MUST fail, `record-adapter` MUST
  be skipped, and `framework.local.json` MUST NOT be created or updated

> **Enforced by:** `skills/reference/personal-setup-gate.mdSKILL.md`,
> `harness/scripts/init-orchestrate.ts`,
> `harness/tests/unit/init-orchestrate-smoke.unit.test.ts`
