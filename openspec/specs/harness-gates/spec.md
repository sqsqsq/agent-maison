# Harness Gates Specification

## Purpose

Define the acceptance gates that MUST pass when AgentMaison publishable content
(`skills/`, `specs/`, `harness/`, etc.) is modified.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Harness unit tests must pass after publishable changes

The system MUST require `cd harness && npm test` to pass with zero failures before
any change to publishable content is considered complete.

#### Scenario: All harness tests pass
- **WHEN** a developer modifies files under `harness/`, `specs/`, `skills/`, or `workflows/`
- **THEN** running `npm test` from the repository root (or `npm test` inside `harness/`) MUST report all tests PASS

> **Enforced by:** `AGENTS.md`, `harness/package.json`, `harness/tests/`

### Requirement: Consumer release npm test uses check global phases

The consumer `npm test` script MUST be redefined to `check:global` (catalog + glossary + docs),
matching S3 `run-global-phases` behavior. In the release zip, `harness/tests/` is excluded
from the artifact. Source repo `npm test` (unit + fixtures) remains the developer gate unchanged.

#### Scenario: Release harness package has consumer test semantics
- **WHEN** `npm run release:verify` inspects the staged or extracted release artifact
- **THEN** `harness/package.json` MUST NOT contain `test:unit` or `test:fixtures`,
  MUST contain `check:global`, and `scripts.test` MUST equal `npm run check:global`

> **Enforced by:** `scripts/release-pack-rules.mjs`, `scripts/verify-release-pack.mjs`

### Requirement: Phase check scripts enforce phase-rules

The system SHALL enforce each harness phase using a dedicated check script paired
with a phase-rules YAML file under `specs/phase-rules/`.

#### Scenario: PRD phase has check and rule pair
- **WHEN** harness-runner executes the `prd` phase
- **THEN** it MUST invoke `harness/scripts/check-spec.ts` against `specs/phase-rules/spec-rules.yaml`

#### Scenario: Workflow DAG defines phase dependencies
- **WHEN** harness resolves the active workflow
- **THEN** it MUST load `workflows/spec-driven.workflow.yaml` (or the configured `active_workflow`) and honor each artifact's `requires` dependencies

> **Enforced by:** `workflows/spec-driven.workflow.yaml`, `specs/workflow-schema.json`, `harness/scripts/check-*.ts`, `specs/phase-rules/*.yaml`

### Requirement: Release verify is mandatory for dev-tool changes

The system MUST require `npm run release:verify` to pass when changes touch
developer-only directories (`.cursor/`, `.codex/`, `openspec/`) to prevent
accidental leakage into the release artifact.

#### Scenario: Dev-tool change verified before merge
- **WHEN** a change adds or modifies files under `openspec/` or `.cursor/`
- **THEN** `npm run release:verify` MUST pass confirming excluded paths are absent from the zip

> **Enforced by:** `scripts/verify-release-pack.mjs`, `scripts/release-excludes.json`

### Requirement: check-init probe phase is read-only

The init inspection harness MUST NOT perform filesystem writes during probe.
Writes previously done in check-init (gitignore ensure, deprecated cleanup,
auto_overwrite sync) MUST be delegated to init-orchestrate approved tasks.

#### Scenario: check-init probe does not write gitignore
- **WHEN** harness init phase runs against a project root without `.gitignore`
- **THEN** the probe completes without creating or modifying `.gitignore`, and
  inspection #11 reports `MISSING` until S3 `ensure-gitignore` executes

> **Enforced by:** `harness/scripts/check-init.ts`,
> `harness/scripts/utils/init-task-planner.ts`

### Requirement: Init and setup registry is select-only

`confirmation-registry.yaml` entries for init/setup orchestration MUST NOT
expose `value: custom` or options that collect free-text paths or profile name
strings. Lint MUST fail such entries.

#### Scenario: init.project_profile has preset options only
- **WHEN** `check-skills-confirmation-ux.ts` lints the registry
- **THEN** `init.project_profile` MUST NOT include `value: custom`,
  `init.toolchain_path` MUST NOT be present, `init.populated_diff` MUST NOT
  be present, and `init.adapter` MUST NOT be present

#### Scenario: init.setup portable has no legacy Q1/y channels
- **WHEN** lint scans init/setup registry entries
- **THEN** `portable` / `portable_menu` MUST NOT contain `Q1=`, `all=y`,
  `all=n`, or bare `y=` / `N=` shorthands

### Requirement: Init setup prompts forbid architecture free-text questionnaires

`skills/project/framework-init/prompts/**` and `templates/**` MUST NOT instruct
agents to collect architecture DSL fields via conversational questionnaires
(fully custom flows, field-by-field collection, sublayer follow-up prompts).

#### Scenario: architecture preset docs use select-or-stop only
- **WHEN** `check-skills-confirmation-ux.ts` lints init prompts and templates
- **THEN** files MUST NOT contain interactive patterns such as
  `完全自定义`, `收集字段`, `手工拼装 JSON`, `逐项确认`, `追加问卷`,
  or `继续追问` (except lines explicitly marked as forbidden anti-patterns)

> **Enforced by:** `skills/project/framework-init/prompts/**`,
> `skills/project/framework-init/templates/**`,
> `skills/reference/user-confirmation-ux.md`,
> `harness/scripts/check-skills-confirmation-ux.ts`

### Requirement: hmos-app profile accepts HSP as library module format

The system SHALL treat `HSP` as a valid value for
`doc/module-catalog.yaml > modules[].format` and for design `contracts.yaml >
modules[].format` when the active project profile is `hmos-app`, equivalent to
`HAR` for library export and freshness checks.

#### Scenario: Catalog format_value_valid accepts HSP
- **WHEN** harness-runner executes the `catalog` phase against an hmos-app project
- **AND** `doc/module-catalog.yaml` contains a module with `format: HSP`
- **THEN** `check-catalog.ts` MUST NOT emit `format_value_valid` FAIL for that module
- **AND** `format_value_valid` allowed values MUST be sourced from
  `profiles/hmos-app/profile.yaml > catalog_allowed_module_formats` (including `HSP`)

#### Scenario: HSP modules participate in library export checks
- **WHEN** an hmos-app catalog module has `format: HSP`
- **AND** the module has a resolvable `oh-package.json5 main` export entry
- **THEN** `entry_file_matches_oh_package_main` and `key_exports_fresh_vs_index` MUST
  evaluate that module the same as a `format: HAR` library module
- **AND** coding phase `har_index_export` MUST evaluate contracts modules with
  `format: HSP` the same as `format: HAR`

#### Scenario: Other profiles unchanged
- **WHEN** the active project profile is not `hmos-app` (e.g. `generic`)
- **THEN** this requirement MUST NOT imply global framework support for `HSP`
- **AND** that profile's own `catalog_allowed_module_formats` SSOT remains authoritative

> **Enforced by:** `profiles/hmos-app/profile.yaml`, `profiles/hmos-app/harness/har-export-resolve.ts`,
> `profiles/hmos-app/harness/catalog-entry-file-har.ts`, `profiles/hmos-app/harness/catalog-key-exports-har.ts`,
> `profiles/hmos-app/harness/coding-host-rules.ts`, `harness/scripts/check-catalog.ts`

### Requirement: Workflow manifest supports goal transition fields

The system SHALL extend `specs/workflow-schema.json` and `workflow-loader` to accept optional `transition_policy` and `auto_chain` on workflow manifests.

Enforcement: `specs/workflow-schema.json`, `harness/workflow-loader.ts`, `workflows/spec-driven.workflow.yaml`

#### Scenario: Spec-driven workflow loads transition_policy

- **WHEN** `spec-driven.workflow.yaml` includes `transition_policy: manual`
- **THEN** workflow-loader MUST parse it without validation error

### Requirement: Phase transition policy supports goal_mode resolution

The system SHALL implement `resolveAutoChain` and `classifyPhaseVerdict` in `phase-transition-policy.ts` for goal-runner consumption.

Enforcement: `harness/scripts/utils/phase-transition-policy.ts`

#### Scenario: INCOMPLETE with deferrable block continues when allowed

- **WHEN** classifyPhaseVerdict receives INCOMPLETE with deferrable blocking_class per dependency_policy
- **THEN** it MUST return `defer_external_and_continue_if_allowed`

### Requirement: Init gitignore includes feature goal-runs

The system SHALL include `doc/features/*/goal-runs/` in canonical init `.gitignore` patterns via `ensure-gitignore`, without ignoring the entire `doc/features/` tree.

Enforcement: `harness/scripts/utils/canonical-gitignore.ts`, `harness/scripts/utils/init-task-executor.ts`

#### Scenario: Fresh init adds goal-runs ignore

- **WHEN** `ensureCanonicalGitignore` runs on a project without the pattern
- **THEN** `.gitignore` MUST gain `doc/features/*/goal-runs/` while retaining existing `doc/features/*/*/reports/*` and `/doc/features/_adhoc/` patterns

### Requirement: Screen-locked device produces the existing external-block contract

hmos-app profile 的 UT 失败分类 MUST 对设备锁屏产出 `blocking_class='externalBlocked'` 与 `failure_kind='device_blocked'`，从而落入既有 `DEFAULT_DEPENDENCY_POLICY` 的可 defer 契约。MUST NOT 停留在默认的 `toolchain:false` 分支（该分支会使上层兜底为 `code_regression`）。

精确原因 MUST 只保留在 blocker 的 `details_excerpt` 或既有 HDC diagnosis 中。MUST NOT 新增 summary 顶层字段（`summary.schema.json` 为 `additionalProperties:false`，且该原因仅供人读，不应扩大协议面）。

上游 verdict gate 的环境层指引措辞 MUST 表述为「请人解锁真机」，MUST NOT 使用可被 agent 读作自我指令的「解锁真机」。

#### Scenario: 锁屏归入设备阻断
- **WHEN** `aa test` 因屏幕锁定失败
- **THEN** CheckResult 带 `blocking_class='externalBlocked'` 与 `failure_kind='device_blocked'`

#### Scenario: 混合失败不整体 defer
- **WHEN** 同一 phase 内模块 A 因锁屏失败、模块 B 用例真实失败
- **THEN** MUST NOT 整体判 defer；模块 B 的真实失败仍须 FAIL（设备问题不得掩盖代码问题）

### Requirement: Emulator-backed testing cannot claim a full pass

testing 阶段结论 MUST 由 runner 依可信 device session 派生：当 `target_kind ∈ {emulator, unknown}` 时，**无论 agent summary 声称什么**，最终结论 MUST 封顶为 PARTIAL/DEFERRED，MUST NOT 判定整体 READY/COMPLETED。ut 阶段允许在模拟器上取得 PASS。

该封顶 MUST NOT 依赖 agent 自报（自报即可绕过）。

#### Scenario: 模拟器 testing 不得冒充真机通过
- **WHEN** testing 在托管模拟器上执行且 agent summary 自报 PASS
- **THEN** runner 依 device session 将结论降为 PARTIAL/DEFERRED

#### Scenario: unknown 不被推断为真机
- **WHEN** `target_kind` 无法由正面证据确认
- **THEN** 记 `unknown` 并按模拟器同等封顶处理

### Requirement: Full-track closure is published by staged summary commit
The closure finalizer SHALL validate evidence, construct final summary 1.2 bytes, generate the phase evidence manifest from the staged summary hash while recording the canonical summary path, strictly update `.current-phase.json`, and atomically publish the staged summary last. Enforcement SHALL be implemented in `harness/scripts/check-receipt.ts`, `harness/scripts/utils/phase-state.ts`, and `harness/scripts/utils/phase-evidence-manifest.ts`.

#### Scenario: Manifest generation fails
- **WHEN** closure evidence validation passes but attestation, manifest, or pointer generation fails
- **THEN** canonical summary MUST remain open and downstream recommendation MUST remain ineligible

#### Scenario: Staged summary is published
- **WHEN** finalization succeeds
- **THEN** recomputing the manifest entry for canonical `summary.json` SHALL match the bytes published by the atomic rename

### Requirement: Summary 1.2 distinguishes verified closure and quality depth
`harness/schemas/summary.schema.json` and mirrored TypeScript readers SHALL support schema 1.2 with `depth` and versioned `closure_commit@1`. Full-track closure SHALL require the commit marker and a valid manifest.

#### Scenario: Existing summary lacks depth
- **WHEN** a 1.0 or 1.1 summary is consumed after upgrade
- **THEN** depth SHALL be `unknown` until harness rerun or explicit validating migration

### Requirement: Phase-state persistence is strict during closure
The closure finalizer MUST treat `.current-phase.json` write failure as a failed finalization rather than logging a warning and publishing closed summary state.

#### Scenario: Current-phase state cannot be persisted
- **WHEN** strict phase-state writing fails after evidence artifacts are staged
- **THEN** the finalizer MUST stop before canonical summary commit

### Requirement: Harness output includes deterministic next-step guidance
Feature-scope phase checks SHALL append a bounded next-step block outside the existing `HARNESS_SUMMARY` machine block. Global, sentinel `_global`, and `--adhoc-correction` paths SHALL remain silent.

#### Scenario: Feature phase check completes
- **WHEN** a supported feature phase reaches harness exit
- **THEN** output SHALL include the current feature/phase/mode status and the assessment recommendation without changing the machine block

### Requirement: The fidelity pregate re-verifies the routing SSOT instead of first-producing decisions

`fidelity_capability_pregate` SHALL load `fidelity-intent.json` and re-verify: internal consistency (`effective == clamp(selected, capability-snapshot)`), spec.md Visual Handoff projection consistency (`fidelity_target`/`asset_acquisition_mode` mismatches are BLOCKER with an agent-auto-fix-the-projection suggestion — never escalated to a user question), goal-env requirement-sha staleness, and the single genuine conflict (selected=pixel ∧ hard ∧ clamped → DEFERRED semantics). For UI-relevant features a missing SSOT is BLOCKER pointing at the initializer command; non-UI features (no ui-spec, no handoff, no reference images) proceed without one. The pregate SHALL NOT produce the decision.

Enforcement: `harness/scripts/check-spec.ts`, `harness/scripts/utils/fidelity-shared.ts`

#### Scenario: projection drift is agent-fixable, not a user question

- **WHEN** spec.md declares fidelity_target=semantic_layout while the SSOT selected pixel_1to1
- **THEN** the gate FAILs naming the projection mismatch and instructs the agent to fix the projection from the SSOT

### Requirement: Ruling-class escalation reads the hard-pixel contract; execution keeps the pixel target

Severity ratcheting (WARN→BLOCKER), human-confirmation requirements and completion capping SHALL key on `isHardPixelContract` (effective=pixel_1to1 ∧ strictness=hard); high-fidelity execution machinery (extraction, diff/metrics, layout dumps) keeps keying on the pixel execution target. Under best_effort, quality gaps keep their default severities and are recorded as visual debt — never silently dropped. Deterministic integrity failures (corruption, path escape, forged evidence, ledger tampering) remain unconditional BLOCKERs regardless of strictness.

Enforcement: `harness/scripts/utils/fidelity-shared.ts`, `harness/scripts/check-testing.ts`, `harness/scripts/check-spec.ts`, `harness/harness-runner.ts`

#### Scenario: best_effort records debt without ratchet halt

- **WHEN** a pixel-target best_effort run has an unconfirmed visual gap
- **THEN** the finding stays at its default severity with debt recorded, and no human final confirmation is demanded; the same scenario with strictness=hard escalates to BLOCKER

### Requirement: Blind-crop c3 waiver requires this-invocation machine verification with binding revalidation

Under a blind adapter, a crop asset SHALL be admitted without per-item human pre-confirmation ONLY when the spec asset-acquisition provider confirmedly executed in the current invocation (skip/throw disqualifies disk reports), the entry is `verified` by the strict producer (sanity — including existing blank/uniform detection — plus independent VL recognition or human bbox overrule; producer semantics are not lowered), and the artifact's hash/resolved_path binding revalidates. Otherwise the asset falls back to visible placeholder + visual debt (proceeding) or the human-confirmation route; a pre-written verified-looking report grants no waiver.

Enforcement: `harness/scripts/check-spec.ts`, `profiles/hmos-app/harness/asset-crop-validation.ts`

#### Scenario: forged verified report with a skipped provider does not waive c3

- **WHEN** an agent pre-writes a complete verified entry and the provider did not run in this invocation
- **THEN** the crop stays unadmitted and the run proceeds via placeholder+debt or human confirmation, not via the forged report
