# Harness Gates Specification

## Purpose

Define the acceptance gates that MUST pass when AgentMaison publishable content
(`skills/`, `specs/`, `harness/`, etc.) is modified.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Harness unit tests must pass after publishable changes

The system MUST require `cd harness && npm test` to pass with zero failures before
any change to publishable content is considered complete.

#### Scenario: All harness tests pass
- **WHEN** a developer modifies files under `harness/`, `specs/`, `skills/`, or `workflows/`
- **THEN** running `npm test` from the repository root (or `npm test` inside `harness/`) MUST report all tests PASS

> **Enforced by:** `AGENTS.md`, `harness/package.json`, `harness/tests/`

### Requirement: Phase check scripts enforce phase-rules

The system SHALL enforce each harness phase using a dedicated check script paired
with a phase-rules YAML file under `specs/phase-rules/`.

#### Scenario: PRD phase has check and rule pair
- **WHEN** harness-runner executes the `prd` phase
- **THEN** it MUST invoke `harness/scripts/check-prd.ts` against `specs/phase-rules/prd-rules.yaml`

#### Scenario: Workflow DAG defines phase dependencies
- **WHEN** harness resolves the active workflow
- **THEN** it MUST load `workflows/spec-driven.workflow.yaml` (or the configured `active_workflow`) and honor each artifact's `requires` dependencies

> **Enforced by:** `workflows/spec-driven.workflow.yaml`, `specs/workflow-schema.json`, `harness/scripts/check-*.ts`, `specs/phase-rules/*.yaml`

### Requirement: Release verify is mandatory for dev-tool changes

The system MUST require `npm run release:verify` to pass when changes touch
developer-only directories (`.cursor/`, `.codex/`, `openspec/`) to prevent
accidental leakage into the release artifact.

#### Scenario: Dev-tool change verified before merge
- **WHEN** a change adds or modifies files under `openspec/` or `.cursor/`
- **THEN** `npm run release:verify` MUST pass confirming excluded paths are absent from the zip

> **Enforced by:** `scripts/verify-release-pack.mjs`, `scripts/release-excludes.json`
