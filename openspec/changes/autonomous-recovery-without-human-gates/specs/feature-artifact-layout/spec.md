## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: New governance artifacts have fixed locations and ownership

The feature tree SHALL host `<phase>/headless-assumptions.jsonl` as an agent-written, schema-checked audit record with an optional markdown projection; `review/reports/review-closure-attestation.json` as harness-written machine evidence; acceptance `flows`, per-AC structured checkpoints, and `requirement_ref` as spec-owned hash-bound contracts; and testing runtime observations inside the existing device-test evidence and phase-evidence locations. New runs MUST NOT create `testing/skip-waivers.yaml`, phase behavior-switch waivers, human visual acceptance receipts, mutation-adjudication receipts, or other quality-lowering confirmation artifacts. `feature-completion.json` originals remain in the runner-owned run directory with only a projection/reference in the feature directory. All authoritative artifacts SHALL be consumed through recomputation-based verification, never existence or signer-name checks.

Enforcement: `harness/scripts/utils/phase-evidence-manifest.ts`, `harness/scripts/utils/verify-feature-completion.ts`, `harness/scripts/utils/device-test-evidence-shared.ts`, `specs/phase-rules/*.yaml`

#### Scenario: old waiver files remain on disk

- **WHEN** an upgraded consumer contains legacy skip-waiver, behavior-waiver, or human visual receipt files
- **THEN** readers MAY report them as deprecated history, but no current gate, closure, or completion decision SHALL consume them

### Requirement: Visual debt lives in a harness-derived JSON ledger with a markdown projection

`doc/features/<feature>/visual-debt.json` SHALL be the machine truth for visual debt, derived by the harness from current asset, ui-spec, deterministic visual, provider, materialization, and render-visibility evidence — never agent-authored. Entries carry stable identity, source check, optional asset/screen identity, severity, status `open|closed`, and a machine resolution class. `closed` means fixed and reverified; there is no `accepted` quality-bypass state and new entries MUST NOT carry `accepted_by` or `acceptance_receipt`. `visual-debt.md` is a human projection only. Open required debt maps to the existing quality axes and blocks release; optional unverified debt remains advisory only where existing release policy permits it.

Enforcement: `harness/scripts/utils/visual-debt.ts`, `harness/harness-runner.ts`, `harness/scripts/check-testing.ts`

#### Scenario: a user name cannot close visual debt

- **WHEN** an open visual debt entry has legacy acceptance metadata but its source evidence has not been fixed and reverified
- **THEN** the entry SHALL remain open for current projection and release SHALL remain blocked when the axis is required

### Requirement: Blind-tier asset requests are a standing artifact with a confirmation flow

When assets cannot be trusted-cropped, spec SHALL emit `doc/features/<feature>/spec/asset-request.md` with each item's purpose, suggested dimensions, drop path, and current placeholder kind. A run MAY consume user-supplied files or bounding boxes as frozen input provenance, but no mid-run signature is required to continue. The automated path SHALL use role-appropriate placeholders where allowed and keep brand-critical placeholders release-blocking; after supplied assets appear, re-running the owner phase SHALL absorb them through source, binding, and render verification.

Enforcement: `harness/scripts/check-spec.ts`, `harness/scripts/utils/visual-debt.ts`, `profiles/hmos-app/harness/asset-crop-validation.ts`

#### Scenario: unattended run lacks a trustworthy crop

- **WHEN** an unattended run cannot verify a requested crop and no supplied asset exists
- **THEN** it SHALL materialize only an allowed visible placeholder or fail/defer according to asset criticality, and SHALL NOT stop for a signature

### Requirement: Blind-mode placeholder metadata is schema-valid but non-authoritative

The ui-spec token schema SHALL allow `placeholder:boolean` and `value_source:string`; the asset schema SHALL accept legacy `blind_fallback_reason` and `crop_confirmed_by` fields for compatibility. These fields SHALL document fallback/input provenance only and MUST NOT count as visual verification, human authorization, or a reason to lower current execution capability. New writers SHALL use neutral source/tool/hash provenance and MUST NOT produce `crop_confirmed_by` or `human_crop_confirmed` as quality authority.

Enforcement: `harness/schemas/ui-spec.schema.json`, `profiles/hmos-app/harness/ui-spec-schema-validate.ts`, `harness/scripts/utils/ui-spec-shared.ts`

#### Scenario: legacy crop confirmation is inert

- **WHEN** an existing ui-spec contains `crop_confirmed_by: user_requirement`
- **THEN** schema compatibility SHALL allow the field, but crop admission SHALL still require current source/hash/tool evidence

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Runtime observations reuse device and phase evidence locations

P0 runtime step observations SHALL be stored within the existing `device-test-evidence.json`/Hylyre run directory and referenced by the testing phase evidence manifest. The framework MUST NOT create a runtime-confirmation receipt, signature ledger, or off-repository trust record.

Enforcement: `harness/scripts/utils/device-test-evidence-shared.ts`, `profiles/hmos-app/harness/device-test-evidence.ts`, `harness/scripts/utils/phase-evidence-manifest.ts`

#### Scenario: runtime evidence participates in closure freshness

- **WHEN** a bound trace, HAP, product source aggregate, flow, or step observation changes after testing closure
- **THEN** testing closure and feature completion SHALL become stale through the existing evidence-manifest verification
