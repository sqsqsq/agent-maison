## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Phase-scoped feature artifacts use canonical nested paths

The framework SHALL resolve phase-scoped feature artifacts under
`doc/features/<feature>/<phase>/<basename>` as the canonical write path, where
`<phase>` is determined by `PHASE_SCOPED_ARTIFACTS` in `harness/config.ts`.

Global cross-phase contracts (`acceptance.yaml`, `contracts.yaml`,
`use-cases.yaml`, `boundaries.yaml`, `compat.yaml`) SHALL remain at the feature
root directory.

#### Scenario: Spec written under spec subdirectory
- **WHEN** an agent writes `spec.md` for feature `demo`
- **THEN** the canonical path SHALL be `doc/features/demo/spec/spec.md`

#### Scenario: Plan written under plan subdirectory
- **WHEN** an agent writes `plan.md` for feature `demo`
- **THEN** the canonical path SHALL be `doc/features/demo/plan/plan.md`

#### Scenario: Global contract stays at feature root
- **WHEN** harness loads `contracts.yaml` for feature `demo`
- **THEN** the canonical path SHALL be `doc/features/demo/contracts.yaml`

### Requirement: Dual-read legacy flat paths on read

On read, the framework SHALL prefer the canonical nested path when it exists.
When only legacy paths exist (`prd/spec.md`, flat `spec.md`, `design/design.md`,
flat `design.md`), the framework SHALL return the legacy file as `actualPath`
with `usedLegacy=true`.

#### Scenario: Legacy nested PRD still readable
- **WHEN** `doc/features/demo/spec/spec.md` exists and `doc/features/demo/spec/spec.md` does not
- **THEN** `resolveFeatureArtifact` for `spec.md` SHALL set `exists=true`, `usedLegacy=true`

#### Scenario: Legacy flat PRD still readable
- **WHEN** `doc/features/demo/spec.md` exists and canonical spec path does not
- **THEN** `resolveFeatureArtifact` for `spec.md` SHALL set `exists=true`, `usedLegacy=true`

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Feature lifecycle artifact retention

After a feature workflow completes, the framework SHALL retain `contracts.yaml`,
`use-cases.yaml`, and `acceptance.yaml` permanently at the feature root.
The framework MAY allow `plan/plan.md` narrative to be archived or downgraded.

#### Scenario: Plan ephemeral after feature close
- **WHEN** a feature reaches testing PASS and is marked closed
- **THEN** harness SHALL still resolve `contracts.yaml` at the feature root indefinitely

### Requirement: Process checklist items excluded from main templates

The framework SHALL NOT require operational process sections (admin console
scheduling, analytics/SVN, translation, TA coordination, demo scheduling) in
core `spec` or `plan` templates. Hosts MAY supply them via extension checklists
or lifecycle hooks.

#### Scenario: Core spec template has no SVN section
- **WHEN** harness validates a generic profile spec against phase-rules
- **THEN** absence of an SVN archival section SHALL NOT fail structure checks
