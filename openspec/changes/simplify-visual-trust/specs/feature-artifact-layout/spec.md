## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: fidelity-intent.json is the single SSOT for the three routing axes

`<feature>/spec/reports/fidelity-intent.json` SHALL record `inferred_fidelity`/`selected_fidelity`/`effective_fidelity`, `acceptance_strictness`, `asset_acquisition_mode`, clamp state, decision metadata, execution identity and a stable requirement hash. `<feature>/spec/reports/capability-snapshot.json` SHALL record only the current execution probe/canary verdict and source. spec.md/ui-spec `fidelity_target` SHALL project selected fidelity; effective fidelity is execution metadata and SHALL NOT overwrite that projection. Artifact attestation and historical policy state MUST NOT enter either record.

Enforcement: `harness/scripts/utils/fidelity-shared.ts`, `harness/scripts/utils/goal-preflight.ts`, `harness/scripts/fidelity-intent-init.ts`, `harness/harness-runner.ts`

#### Scenario: Existing visual artifacts do not alter snapshot capability

- **WHEN** initialization runs with an existing unverified ui-spec and the current model probe succeeds
- **THEN** capability-snapshot records vision=true from the probe and fidelity routing uses that current capability

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Visual execution artifacts are current receipts only

The feature vision directory SHALL use `capability-receipt.json` and `spec-refs-receipt.json` as short-lived current execution evidence. The framework SHALL NOT require or maintain feature-scoped artifact-attestation or policy-downgrade ledgers.

Enforcement: `harness/scripts/goal-runner.ts`, `harness/scripts/utils/critic-receipt-producer.ts`, `harness/scripts/utils/effective-vision-context.ts`

#### Scenario: Upgraded consumer keeps old ledgers without migration

- **WHEN** a consumer upgrades while old visual JSONL ledgers remain on disk
- **THEN** initialization proceeds without reading, migrating, anchoring, or deleting those files

### Requirement: Blind-mode placeholder metadata is schema-valid but non-authoritative

The ui-spec token schema SHALL allow `placeholder:boolean` and `value_source:string`; the asset schema SHALL allow `blind_fallback_reason:string` and `crop_confirmed_by:string|null`. These fields SHALL only document fallback provenance or missing confirmation and MUST NOT count as visual verification, human authorization, or a reason to lower current execution capability.

Enforcement: `harness/schemas/ui-spec.schema.json`, `profiles/hmos-app/harness/ui-spec-schema-validate.ts`, `harness/scripts/utils/ui-spec-shared.ts`

#### Scenario: Honest blind placeholders do not create schema-noise storms

- **WHEN** a blind-mode ui-spec marks neutral token values as placeholders and records asset fallback reasons with null crop confirmation
- **THEN** those fields pass structural schema validation while genuine unknown fields and missing placeholder rationale remain actionable
